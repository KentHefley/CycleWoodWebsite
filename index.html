			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<img src="img/logo2.png" alt="CycleWood Associates Main Logo">
			<p>Founded in 2010, cycleWood Associates saw the damage that plastic bags are having on our environment. Plastics constitute many of the modern products that have given us conveniences that we enjoy today. However, in time, we have seen some of the negative implications of relying so heavily on plastics. For example, plastic bags take 1000 years to decompose, which means that every single modern plastic bag that has ever been manufactured is still in existence today. With 32 million tons of plastic created every day, The waste generated is increasingly contributing to the litter in our oceans, waterways, and countryside. They are filling up our landfills, and they have terrible, often fatal, effects on wildlife.</p>
			<h3>Lignin is a natural byproduct of the paper industry and has many benefits.</h3>
			<p>Over the last few years, cycleWood Associates has perfected the process of replacing traditional plastics with products made with lignin, allowing consumers to have many of the modern conveniences that we are used to with none of the harmful environmental effects.</p>

				<h3>Manufacturing Solutions</h3>
				<p class="left">Many companies have ongoing efforts to lower their carbon footprint across all phases of their business. Constantly companies are announcing 	goals to reduce their emissions intensity and petroleum dependency in their product portfolio by significant percentages in the next 3-5 years.
					Our innovative lignin-based technologies are viewed by many as the next generation in bio-thermoplastics. We have mastered the ability to create entirely sustainable bio-resin materials with excellent properties for minimal costs. As these materials become integrated across industries, the environmental and sustainable impacts will be significant.</p>
					<p class="left">Our lignin-based materials are the most sustainable bio-resins in the world. Currently, the lignin portion of every tree harvested for the production of paper products is burned in the paper mill’s recovery boiler to generate heat value. The total energy savings to the mill amounts to $0.04 per pound of lignin burned. This is essentially the cheapest way to dispose of this material. This would only be a small issue if not for the fact that lignin makes up ~30% of each tree. Our process uses lignin that would otherwise be wasted by the paper mill industry. No additional trees are cut down to produce our lignin based plastics.

					<h3>Retail Solutions</h3>
					<p>Retailers across the US and the world are looking to add the most value that they can to their consumers and to the world. cycleWood Associates has products that will satisfy your increasingly environmentally conscious consumers and technology that will help you to meet your sustainability initiatives.</p>
					<p>Xylobags Tall Kitchen Bags and Lawn and Leaf bags are helping consumers find compostable and biodegradable products that hold up more like traditional polyethylene than any other compostable bag out there. On the supply side, our Xylomer technology is helping retailers with their waste disposal efforts and minimizing their use of fossil fuel-based materials. 
					</p>
					<p>We can also work with you and your suppliers to develop a quick and cost-effective solution to most plastic applications within the retail world. Things like plastic pallets, milk and dairy crates, shopping baskets and packaging can all be manufactured with 40-60% non-petroleum based plastic content.</p>

					<h3>Government Solutions</h3>
					<h4 id="green-text">Green Waste diversion programs are
						being adopted by cities across the United States.</h4>
					<p>Up to 40% of landfill material is made up of recyclable tree waste. A diversion program could ultimately divert tens of thousands of tons of lawn waste to compost facilities.</p>
					<p>Composting facilities charge significantly less per ton than landfills. Larger cities with ongoing diversion programs have seen savings in the millions of dollars.

			<h2>The Cycle</h2>
			<img class="cycle" src="img/xyloCycle3.png" alt="The Cycle Diagram" title="The Cycle Diagram">
			<p>We modify lignin, an abundant, natural byproduct of the paper manufacturing process, and blend it with other compostable polymers to create our plastic products. The main benefit of using our Xylomer™ technology is that our products breaks down into humus in approximately 180 days once they have reached the natural environment, improving soil structure and leaving a cleaner environment. With government regulation restricting the use of harmful high-density polyethylene plastics, our products provide retailers with a viable, cheap plastic alternative. Our lignin based plastics allow consumers to eliminate unsightly plastic litter from their communities.</p>
			<h3>Processing</h3>
			<p>Our Xylomer™ pellets are a proprietary blend of polymers and additives to produce a 100% biodegradable and compostable thermoplastic. The pellets are produced on standard compounding equipment. We transform our Xylomer™ pellets into many different products using existing converting equipment. To date, we have produced single-use plastic bags, trash can liners, and meat bags on commercial blown extrusion lines. Additionally, we have used the Xylomer™ pellets in injection molding and vacuum forming processes to create samples of cups and bowls.</p>
